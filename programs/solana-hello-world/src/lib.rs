// Now that weâ€™ve defined the Message account, we can implement instructions as part our the Solana program.
// Weâ€™re going implement two instructions - one to create the first message, and one to update that message.

// Because Solana programs are stateless, we need to provide relevant context for each of those instructions.
// To do so, Anchor gives us a way to easily define a context in Rust.
